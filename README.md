Install instructions for the BSX-Jewel (Controller)

Go ahead and disassemble your controller. I recommend doing so completely upside down the whole way, since the buttons will fall out of the front of the shell and fall all over the place once you pull it off.

Apply some heat to the existing jewel, either with a hot air gun or a hair dryer and then carefully pry the jewel up with a tool of your choice. I used a small, flathead screwdrive of the size typically used on eyeglasses. 

You will need to cut a row of plastic out of the recessed section as pictured. This will make room for not only the JST connector, but also the two 0402 resistors on the rear. Your jewel should be able to sit flush in the space.

The rear of the Jewel will tell you what the pinout is. Plug the included cable into the jewel so that you can see what the orientation is and then know which is positive and which is negative. Once you do, go ahead and solder the wires to the proper pins on the PCB. If you look at the opposite side of the board, you will see which is positive and which is negative by seeing the colors of the wires on the connector.

Put the controller back together and push the cable through the slot you cut on the shell. Once the controller is back together, go ahead and use a glue of your choice to glue the jewel to the slot, being careful to align properly and with care. Hot glue can be messy so if you use it, please be careful. In my experience, it doesn't work well, is too thick and ges everywhere. Perhaps superglue. 

I soldered a green LED to the contacts with a current-limiting resistor so that I could have some trademark green glow behind the jewel. However, if your controller shell is black, then you can't do this. Lol.

Congrats.You now have the BSX Jewel installed on your controller. Hope you like it!
